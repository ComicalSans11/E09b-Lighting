# E09b-Lighting

In this assignment, we learned about 3D lighting and camera movement in Godot. We made it so that a cabin 3D model had lighting almost akin to a sunset. The final product showcases the cabin and its surroundings rotating to show all sides of the model and how the lighting and camera interacts with each other in a 3D space.
